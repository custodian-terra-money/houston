<p align="center"><strong>Houston is a development environment, testing framework and smart contract pipeline for Terra, aiming to make life as a Terra developer easier.</strong>
</p>

## Features

- Built-in smart contract compilation, linking, deployment and wasm binary management.
- Configurable build pipeline with support for custom build processes.
- Scriptable deployment & migrations framework.
- Network management for deploying to Terra's public & private networks.
- Instant rebuilding of webassembly binaries during development.

## Installation

_Houston will gracefully setup **a stable version of rust compiler** and **wasm target** to develop smart contracts on Terra blockchain._

Grab the latest version of [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@terra-money/houston):

```sh
npm install -g @terra-money/houston
```

## Documentation

To get more information on Houston, check out the documentation.

## Kickstart

**Houston has five commands to help smart contract development:**

`init`: for project initialization

`compile`: for compiling contracts

`migrate`: for deploying contracts to blockchain

`add`: for adding or downloading contract cargo projects

To get help on each command, run `houston help <command>`.

### Initialize project

```bash
mkdir myProject
cd myProject
houston init
```

Once this operation is completed, you'll now have a project structure with the following items:

```
myProject/
  |- contracts
  | |- starter
  |- wasm
  |- schema
  |- migrations
  | |- 0_deploy_starter.ts 
  |- package.json
  |- tsconfig.json
```

`contracts`: directory for cosmwasm contracts

`wasm`: wasm binaries of compiled contracts

`schema`: generated schema of compiled contracts

`test`: test script directory for contract interaction

`starter`: a starter cosmwasm contract cargo

`package.json`: package manager for migration scripts

`tsconfig.json`: Typscript configuration file for migration scripts

### Compile contracts

Set current working directory inside of the project directory

```shell
houston compile [contractName]
```

All contract cargos in the `contracts` directory will be compiled as default.

`[contractName]` is an optional parameter to specify which cargo to compile with the command.

Once this operation is initiated, you'll see the event in the console as below:

```shell
ðŸ›  Compiling your contracts...
===========================
```

After comilation of each contract, you'll get the directories for compiled results as below:

```shell
> WASM written to /Users/.../<project folder>/wasm
> Schemas written to /Users/.../<project folder>/schemas/<contract name>_schema
```

Compiled WASM binaries will be placed in `wasm` directory as `<contract name>`.wasm.
Generated collection of schema json files will be placed as a directory with the name `<contract name>-schema` in `schemas` directory.

You will have the new project structure with the following items:

```
myProject/
  |- contracts
  | |- starter
  |- wasm
  | |- starter.wasm
  |- schema
  | |- starter-schema
  |   |- config.json
  |   |- ....
  | migrations
  | |- 0_deploy_starter.ts
  | package.json
  | tsconfig.json
```

### Running migrations

run your migraion scripts in `migrations` folder after installing packages with the following command:

```shell
npm install
houston migrate 
```
